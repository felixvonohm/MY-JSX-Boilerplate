I created this with help of Windsurf AI assitant from Codeium.
With npm I installed: electron-vite-react.
I added svelte and vue very easily with windsurf with repository: https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite
The source code of these two commands up here i layed down here, run the app with the following commands:

how to run the app:
download the programming files with the green button, unzip them.
open terminal, go to folder and run this..
npm install
npm run delectron-dev
in a second terminal run this command: npm run dev

further programming:
take a look at different kitchensink' applications from react framework, svelte and vue.
i recommend reading book about, these frameworks, as well as basic and advanced javascript lectures. use the jsx and javascript language at first instead of typescript.
use the react coding interface for structuring components of code. 
use vue to integrate code like tooltips with anchors on the basic ui, maybe change, the code, for _multiple_ vue entry points.
use two-way binding in a common code component.

As 'web development'-backend you should generate code with php, 
If it has to be very object orientated, maybe, use laravel.

Use VS Code as code editor.
install in vs code all extensions for the various programming language(s) and frameworks used.
Personally I use Synthwave'84 as color theme preference.
i recommend learning vim in common, while having the VSCode as preferable programming IDE.
that was it.
