I created this with help of Windsurf AI assitant from Codeium.

how to run the app:
download the programming files, unzip
open terminal, go to folder and run this.
npm install
npm run delectron-dev
in a second terminal run this command: npm run dev

further programming:
make the FraeworkShocase.css and .jsx files away from the boilerplate
take a look at different kitchensink' applications from react framework, svelte and vue.
i recommend reading book about the frameworks, as well as basic and advanced javascirpt lectures. use the jsx and javascript language at first instead of typescript.
use the react coding interface for structuring components of code. 
use vue to integrate code like tooltips with anchors on the basic ui. 
maybe change the code for _multiple_ entry points in vue.
use two-way binding in a common code component.

as 'web development'-backend you should generate code with php, 
if it has to be very object orientated maybe use laravel.

Use VS Code as code editor.
install in vs code all extensions for the various programming language(s) and frameworks used.
Personally I use Synthwave'84 as color theme preference.
i recommend learning vim in common, while having the VSCode as preferable programming IDE.
that was it.
I (P.S.)think a freenet page or a similar webpage for autodidactic web development/ programming should be interesting.
.gitignore if you don't want to upload files into your git account, is to be used.
P.S.S.: i uploaded the programming files to github on this page here with this text (README.txt)
i uploaded the readme3.md for the backlog of the ai instructions.
